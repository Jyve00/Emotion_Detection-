Detection Emotion using speech data





## Use Case 
It can sometimes be very difficult for a doctor to diagnose their patients and in the past few years we have seen many fields take advantage of what machine learning has to offer and the medical industry has also dipped it's toes in the idea. One great use case is using recorded speech data to detect emotions. This could be use full for doctors and therapist when they are evaluating their patients. A session between a doctor and their patient could be recorded and than ran through our model to predict what emotions are detected. This can be extremely use full for doctors and therapist who may miss something when evaluating a patient and can be great for seeing what subjects bring up what emotions.
